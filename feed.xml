      <p>My early Christmas present to myself for 2024. I opened this early because I want to have the time to build it while I'm off from work. A little LEGO building time each day in addition to walking, cooking, movies, and reading sounds like just the thing. This set should make a nice accompaniment to set 10305: Lion Knight's Castle.</p>

          <p>Tonight a local cafe had fresh oysters. This might be a once-a-year event in sleepy Unterägeri, Switzerland. I partook.</p>

          <p>Last Saturday we mounted our vintage 1950's Evergleam aluminum Christmas tree. <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/12/04/status-2022-12-04-21-16-06/">Two years ago</a> we upgraded to Hue smart string lights, but last January when we were taking down the tree, I decided to co-opt the string lights to provide mood lighting for my office (the Hue string lights are far too expensive to use only one month a year). Come December I was reluctant to part with my office mood lighting, so I ordered another set of string lights. Let's see if the process repeats itself next January.</p>
          <p>I couldn't decide which color photo I liked better, so I decided to post both.</p>

      <title>Umbrella</title>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Yesterday was a rainy day, so naturally when I went out in the morning for coffee and errands, I brought my umbrella. However, when I emerged from my favorite coffee shop, my umbrella was missing from the stand out front where I had left it. There was a similar umbrella in a slightly different color, so I hoped that someone had merely taken my umbrella by accident. I don't want the village I live in to be the kind of place where I have to worry about people stealing my shit.</p>
        <p>This morning when I went out for coffee, my umbrella had been returned. Faith in humanity reaffirmed (or at least faith in my fellow residents of this mid-sized Swiss village).</p>

      <title>Morning Walk with Chains</title>

          <p>Returned to Raten today for a shorter walk just wearing chains instead of snowshoes: 3.15km, 96m ascent, 0h:47m, 8°C ☀️. Bus service comes every 30 minutes, so I wanted to keep the walk to under an hour. The return bus conveniently drops me off in front of a coffeeshop and the grocery store, so I was able to fuel up with coffee and do some pre-Thanksgiving grocery shopping.</p>

          <p>The snowfall was two days ago and it was quite warm today, but the snow was still in decent condition and the terrain pretty.</p>

          <p>Raten to Bellevue (and back): 4.97 km, 144 m ascent, 1h:22m, 7°C ⛅️</p>

          <p>We had a relatively big snowfall last night. I wanted to go showshoe up at Raten Pass, but the bus service up there was canceled due to heavy snowfall. I settled for walking the usual farm fields in the valley instead. Maybe tomorrow I can showshoe.</p>

          <p>... by writing a short post about testing Mastodon author tags. It's all very <code>meta</code>. Quite literally because you add a <code>meta</code> tag with the <code>fediverse:creator</code> property to your HTML document's <code>head</code>.</p>

      <title>First Snow of Fall</title>

          <p>I was only expecting rain this morning, not a wintry mix that turned into light snow. Tomorrow afternoon we have a level 3 (of 5) heavy snowfall warning. I need to get the winter tires put on the car.</p>

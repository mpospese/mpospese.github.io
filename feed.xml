          <p>Eight years ago today we moved to Switzerland. Once again it's time to take stock and reflect on the previous year.</p>
          <p>(Previous posts after <a href="https://mpospese.com/2018/08/02/a-year-in-switzerland/">one</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2020/08/02/3-years-in-switzerland/">three</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2021/08/02/4-years-in-switzerland/">four</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/08/02/five-years-in-switzerland/">five</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/">six</a>, and <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/seven-years-in-switzerland.html">seven</a> years in Switzerland.)</p>
          <br>
          <h2>The Past Year</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I continue to enjoy working remotely for PassiveLogic. I've transitioned from working on iOS to writing cross-platform (non-UI) frameworks in Swift. I've traveled once to Salt Lake City, Utah and twice to Amsterdam to visit the offices there.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Learning German</h3>
          <p>Honestly I've not made much progress with my German. I participated in a discussion class last Fall, but so far in 2025 I've not formally studied. However, for the Fall I've signed up for two in-person classes and an online test prep course, and I've already registered for Goethe B2 Listening and Speaking tests in November. I will need the B2 tests in order to be eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Integration</h3>
          <p>I've made some progress this year. I continue to meet up in Zürich roughly monthly to play D&D with a group of Swiss friends (and I continue to run an online D&D campaign for a mostly different set of Swiss friends). Swiss RPG holds monthly get-togethers in Zürich, and I make an effort to attend those. Last month I even attended the first ever Zug get-together and met some folks closer to home (I hope to start playing more locally). I've run D&D games at Zürich PopCon and <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/fantasy-basel-2025-dnd-lego.html">FaBa</a></p>
          <p>Last August I particpated in a local lake cleanup, which was good fun. The group of about 20 volunteers spent four hours removing trash from Lake Ägeri, and then we had a sunset cookout by the lake.</p>
          <p>In February I was invited to a fondue dinner / board game evening, which was amazing.</p>
          <p>Outside of the RPG group though, I struggle to make connections.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>Apart from three business trips, I traveled to the UK to visit Cambridge with my son and domestically I've made a couple trips to Graubunden.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Nature / Outdoors</h3>
          <p>I continue to hike year-round, snowshoe in the winter, and standup paddle in the summer.</p>
          <p>I've been much more active in 2025 than I was in the previous year. In the first six months of 2025, I've already exercised outdoors more days and hiked farther than I did in all of 2024.</p>
          <p>I spent two nights up at the Berggasthaus Wildspitz (and have another night booked in two weeks). I hiked the <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/via-engiadina-plans.html">first four stages of the Via Engiadina</a> six weeks ago, and today I head out to hike the remaining eight stages.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Last Year's Goals</h2>
          <p>How did I do on last year's <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/seven-years-in-switzerland.html?#goals">goals</a>?</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Hits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Hike more stages of the Via Engiadina</li>
              <li>Spend a night in a mountain hut</li>
              <li>Exercise regularly</li>
              <li>Enroll our son in university</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Indeterminate</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Make plans for beyond summer 2025</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Misses</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Improve my conversational German</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <h2 id="goals">Goals for our ninth year in Switzerland</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Spend a night in a new mountain hut</li>
              <li>Exercise regularly</li>
              <li>Pass the B2 Goethe German Listening and Speaking tests</li>
              <li>Improve my conversational German</li>
              <li>Make more concrete plans for the future</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>Our son starts university in the UK in September. I'm not ready to be an empty-nester!</p>
          <p>That said, my plan is to stay right where we're at and eventually apply for my Swiss citizenship.</p>

      <title>Happy 734th, Switzerland! 🇨🇭</title>

        <p>Happy Swiss National Day!</p>
        <p>I hiked up to the White Cross above town and then upon my return picked up coffee and the traditional 1.-August Weggen bread rolls.</p>

        <p>Later in the day I attended the community celebration for an apero, free risotto, and live music.</p>
        <p>Tonight we'll enjoy a cheese fondue for dinner. (Despite it being summer, it's actually been fondue weather recently.)</p>
        <p>Same as <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/happy-733rd-switzerland.html">last year</a>, I'm grateful that I'm on a local contract and get local Swiss holidays off.</p>

      <title>Fantasy Basel 2025 x D&amp;D x LEGO</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 10:33:38 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://crazymilk.net/blog/fantasy-basel-2025-dnd-lego.html</guid>
      <link>https://crazymilk.net/blog/fantasy-basel-2025-dnd-lego.html</link>

      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/fantasy-basel-2025-dnd-lego.webp" alt="LEGO Dungeons and Dragons set 21348 topped with a red LEGO dragon on a wooden table next to some bags of dice and character sheets." width=960 height=720 />
      <p>On the final weekend of May I combined my love for LEGO and D&amp;D when I attended the <a href="https://fantasybasel.ch/en">Fantasy Basel</a> convention and ran four two-hour D&amp;D games using a <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/21348-1/Dungeons-Dragons-Red-Dragon-s-Tale">LEGO set</a> as a battle map and LEGO minifigures as the miniatures. (This was part of a volunteer effort by <a href="https://swissrpg.ch">Swiss RPG</a> that ran 63 two-hour games for 315 attendees over three days.) Everyone seemed to have a good time, so yay!</p>
      <p>I went into this not knowing whether this was a terrible idea or not, but the <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/marketing/lego/red-dragons-tale.pdf">published one-shot</a> worked pretty well for a 2-hour conference setting and every time the group was able to at least reach the final encounter with the evil sorcerer and the dragon within two hours. I definitely improved at running it with each play-through. I think I might try to run it again at <a href="https://herofest.ch/en">HeroFest</a> in Bern and/or <a href="https://www.zurichpopcon.ch/en">Zürich Pop Con</a> in the Fall.</p>

      <title>Via Engiadina Plans</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 16:20:17 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://crazymilk.net/blog/via-engiadina-plans.html</guid>
      <link>https://crazymilk.net/blog/via-engiadina-plans.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
      <p>The <a href="https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-87">Via Engiadina</a> hiking trail in Switzerland is a 12-stage 165 km long-distance hiking trail along the entire length of the Engadine high alpine valley in the eastern canton of Graubunden. For several years I have wanted to hike the entire trail, but have only managed six stages (and never more than two stages on consecutive days).</p>
      <p>This summer I plan to finally hike the entire trail. I will do it in two sections: four stages in mid-June over the Corpus Christi long holiday weekend, and the remaining eight stages either in July or August.</p>
      <p>For the first four stages I will spend three nights in Silvaplana (my destination after the first stage). It might be more fun to spend each night in a different hostel as near as possible to the stage endpoints, but I have a few reasons for staying in Silvaplana:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I was too busy/lazy to book three different places.</li>
        <li>I really like <a href="https://pappalou.ch">Pappa Lou</a> restaurant on the lake in Silvaplana and won't mind eating there every night.</li>
        <li>When you stay more than two nights in the same place, you receive a regional travel card that also works for the mountain railways. I would really like to go up from Corvatsch one day after I've hiked my stage to visit <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/fuorcla-surlej.html">Fuorcla Surlej</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <p>I bought a new lightweight rain jacket (I've worn my previous one until it's rotting away), new trekking poles (I slipped and bent my old ones several years ago), and a pair of field binoculars, and I resoled my hiking boots. I'm really looking forward to this.</p>

      <title>LEGO Set 10332: Medieval Town Square</title>

      <p>My early Christmas present to myself for 2024. I opened this early because I want to have the time to build it while I'm off from work. A little LEGO building time each day in addition to walking, cooking, movies, and reading sounds like just the thing. This set should make a nice accompaniment to set 10305: Lion Knight's Castle.</p>

      <title>Aluminum Xmas Tree</title>

          <p>Last Saturday we mounted our vintage 1950's Evergleam aluminum Christmas tree. <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/12/04/status-2022-12-04-21-16-06/">Two years ago</a> we upgraded to Hue smart string lights, but last January when we were taking down the tree, I decided to co-opt the string lights to provide mood lighting for my office (the Hue string lights are far too expensive to use only one month a year). Come December I was reluctant to part with my office mood lighting, so I ordered another set of string lights. Let's see if the process repeats itself next January.</p>
          <p>I couldn't decide which color photo I liked better, so I decided to post both.</p>

      <title>Umbrella</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 11:54:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Yesterday was a rainy day, so naturally when I went out in the morning for coffee and errands, I brought my umbrella. However, when I emerged from my favorite coffee shop, my umbrella was missing from the stand out front where I had left it. There was a similar umbrella in a slightly different color, so I hoped that someone had merely taken my umbrella by accident. I don't want the village I live in to be the kind of place where I have to worry about people stealing my shit.</p>
        <p>This morning when I went out for coffee, my umbrella had been returned. Faith in humanity reaffirmed (or at least faith in my fellow residents of this mid-sized Swiss village).</p>

      <title>Morning Walk with Chains</title>

          <p>Returned to Raten today for a shorter walk just wearing chains instead of snowshoes: 3.15km, 96m ascent, 0h:47m, 8°C ☀️. Bus service comes every 30 minutes, so I wanted to keep the walk to under an hour. The return bus conveniently drops me off in front of a coffeeshop and the grocery store, so I was able to fuel up with coffee and do some pre-Thanksgiving grocery shopping.</p>

      <p>... over Lake Ägeri this morning. The mist forms occasionally when the water is warmer than the air (a necessary but not sufficient condition). Today was my third day in a row of waking up early and getting a quick 30-minute paddle in before work, but it was the first day with some <a href="https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/weather-and-climate-from-a-to-z/fog/fog-smoking-lakes.html">evaporation fog</a> despite the other two days being colder.</p>

      <title>Fresh Eggs</title>

      <p>Living outside of the big city in Switzerland means living near farms, mostly small ones. I live near three small farms. They all sell their products in small honor system stores. For the farm next door I pick up eggs directly from the coop. They're actually cheaper than grocery store eggs, and I know the chickens are treated well because I can see them pecking in their yard from our apartment. Anyway I picked up fresh eggs on Saturday and was just reflecting on how different this is for me than life in the suburbs in the United States.</p>

      <title>Fuorcla Surlej</title>

        <p>We've been here <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/07/10/fuorcla-surlej/">before</a>, but the Fuorcla Surlej is always worth another visit if you're in the area. It's a short out-and-back hike from the Corvatsch cable car's Murtèl middle station, but the relatively high altitude (2,755m) always keeps the walk interesting for me: 4.59 km, 143m ascent, 1h8m, 11°C ⛅️.</p>

      <p>This weekend we are visiting Sils Maria in the Engadin region of eastern Switzerland. Today I hiked from the funicular station of Muottas Muragl to Lej (Lake) Muragl: 7.76km, 397m ascent, 2h45m, 15°C ⛅️. It was a lovely hike that reached a maximum altitude of 2,750m. I saw cows, horses, and a marmot (and many fellow hikers).</p>

      <title>Seven Years In Switzerland</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 2 Aug 2024 09:38:45 +0200</pubDate>

      <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/seven-years-in-switzerland.webp" alt="View of a lake on a very misty day. The water is blue-green." width=960 height=540 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>Seven years ago today we arrived in Switzerland from Virginia. I try to write these posts annually to take stock and reflect on the previous year.</p>
      <p>(Previous posts after <a href="https://mpospese.com/2018/08/02/a-year-in-switzerland/">one</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2020/08/02/3-years-in-switzerland/">three</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2021/08/02/4-years-in-switzerland/">four</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/08/02/five-years-in-switzerland/">five</a>, and <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/">six</a> years in Switzerland.)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Past Year</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>Nine months ago I started a new role as a Senior iOS Engineer for PassiveLogic. I've traveled to Salt Lake City and Amsterdam twice each. The work is very advanced, and I'm still not over my impostor syndrome, but I am enjoying it. For the first time since moving to Switzerland, I am on a local Swiss contract, so I get the standard four weeks of vacation, local Canton Zug holidays, and payments towards a Swiss pension.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Learning German</h3>
      <p>Last Fall I took a test prep course for the Goethe B1 German exam. I passed the exam in December.</p>
      <p>Last Fall and this Spring I attended a German conversation course that meets one day a week at a local school.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Integration</h3>
      <p>In April I applied for and received my <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/settling-in.html">settlement permit</a> (permanent residency).</p>
      <p>Also in April I started playing D&amp;D in-person with a group of Swiss friends in Zürich. We meet every second or third weekend. (I've played a lot of D&amp;D over the past three years but almost entirely online.)</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Internationally we visited Vienna, North Carolina, Boston, and London (apart from work trips). Within Switzerland we've visited Wengen, Mergoscia, Brienz, and Val Müstair.</p>
      <p>I feel we've made fewer weekend trips over the past year, in part because our son is busier now with high school.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Nature / Outdoors</h3>
      <p>I continue walking locally in the Ägeri valley. In the winter I snowshoe. When it's hot I go out on the lake on my standup paddle board.</p>
      <p>I didn't do any big day hikes in the past year, and I struggled to exercise regularly. I should have hiked, snowshoed, and paddled more often.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Last Year's Goals</h2>
      <p>So how did I do on last year's <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/#goals">goals</a>?</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Hits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply for permanent residency</li>
          <li>Pass the B1 Goethe German test</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Indeterminate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Get hired locally (I'm working for a U.S. company but on a local contract)</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Misses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete the Via Engiadina hiking trail</li>
          <li>Exercise regularly</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Goals for our eighth year in Switzerland</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hike more stages of the Via Engiadina</li>
          <li>Spend a night in a mountain hut</li>
          <li>Exercise regularly</li>
          <li>Improve my conversational German</li>
          <li>Enroll our son in university</li>
          <li>Make plans for beyond summer 2025</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>We will definitely stay here until our son finishes high school next summer. I would like to stay longer. In three years we would be eligible for Swiss citizenship. At this point I really don't want to live anywhere else.</p>

        <p>I hiked up to the White Cross today after about five weeks without exercising. It rained lightly most of the time and thunder rumbled, but there was no lightning and no thunderstorms.</p>

      	<p>Happy Swiss National Day!</p>
      	<p>I celebrated by buying the traditional 1. August Weggli bread rolls and going for a short hike.</p>
      	<p>Once again I'm grateful that I'm on a local contract and get local Swiss holidays off.</p>

        <p>Today is Pfingstmontag (German for Whit Monday). It's not a holiday for me even though all the stores are closed. Lovely day for a SUP outing. The alphorn player was back, so I got a bit of a concert.</p>

        <p>The rain will hold off until this evening, so I made it three days in a row hiking up to the cross.</p>

          <p>Returned to Raten today for a shorter walk just wearing chains instead of snowshoes: 3.15km, 96m ascent, 0h:47m, 8°C ☀️. Bus service comes every 30 minutes, so I wanted to keep the walk to under an hour. The return bus conveniently drops me off in front of a coffeeshop and the grocery store, so I was able to fuel up with coffee and do some pre-Thanksgiving grocery shopping.</p>

          <p>The snowfall was two days ago and it was quite warm today, but the snow was still in decent condition and the terrain pretty.</p>

          <p>Raten to Bellevue (and back): 4.97 km, 144 m ascent, 1h:22m, 7°C ⛅️</p>

          <p>... and there was actually a view from Bellevue today (towards Lake Zürich).</p>

          <p>We had a relatively big snowfall last night. I wanted to go showshoe up at Raten Pass, but the bus service up there was canceled due to heavy snowfall. I settled for walking the usual farm fields in the valley instead. Maybe tomorrow I can showshoe.</p>

          <p>... by writing a short post about testing Mastodon author tags. It's all very <code>meta</code>. Quite literally because you add a <code>meta</code> tag with the <code>fediverse:creator</code> property to your HTML document's <code>head</code>.</p>
          <p>(Hat tip to David Chartier for <a href="https://toot.cafe/@chartier/113516479426771675">pointing me</a> to <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/setting-up-mastodon-author-tags/">Robb Knight's instructions</a>.)</p>

      <title>First Snow of Fall</title>

          <p>I was only expecting rain this morning, not a wintry mix that turned into light snow. Tomorrow afternoon we have a level 3 (of 5) heavy snowfall warning. I need to get the winter tires put on the car.</p>

      <title>It's Grittibänz Season Already</title>

        <p>I was feeling a bit down this afternoon, so I decided to walk out to a local cafe for a cup of coffee and maybe a sweet treat. To my surprise it's already Grittibänz season. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stutenkerl">Grittibänz</a> are bread men made from sweet dough. They are traditional in December around Saint Nicholas Day (<a href="https://www.helvetickitchen.com/recipes/2017/12/4/grittibanz">Recipe</a>).</p>
        <p>It seems like the internet (and perhaps real life) is full of bad stuff lately. Be kind to yourself and don't forget to give yourself a little treat every now and then.</p>

      <p>... for working out on the terrace (that's my <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/mist-over-the-lake.html">paddling</a> gear drying to the side).</p>
      <p>I rarely do this because I like my 32" monitor, extended keyboard, and mouse, but every now and then it's good to mix things up. As soon as the sun reaches me though I'm back indoors.</p>

      <title>Just a Little Bit of Mist</title>

Forested hills still in shadow lie in the background. The sky is blue with a few low clouds." width=960 height=540 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>... over Lake Ägeri this morning. The mist forms occasionally when the water is warmer than the air (a necessary but not sufficient condition). Today was my third day in a row of waking up early and getting a quick 30-minute paddle in before work, but it was the first day with some <a href="https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/weather/weather-and-climate-from-a-to-z/fog/fog-smoking-lakes.html">evaporation fog</a> despite the other two days being colder.</p>

      <title>Fresh Eggs</title>

      <p>Living outside of the big city in Switzerland means living near farms, mostly small ones. I live near three small farms. They all sell their products in small honor system stores. For the farm next door I pick up eggs directly from the coop. They're actually cheaper than grocery store eggs, and I know the chickens are treated well because I can see them pecking in their yard from our apartment. Anyway I picked up fresh eggs on Saturday and was just reflecting on how different this is for me than life in the suburbs in the United States.</p>

      <p>When I decided that I wanted to ditch WordPress and rewrite my website as a static site, I was unsure where and how I wanted to host it. I've paid Bluehost to host my <a href="https://mpospese.com">old WordPress site</a>, but I wasn't quite ready to nuke my existing WordPress install and replace it (and I might never be), so I needed another domain and another hosting solution.</p>
      <p>The domain part was easy because I had a domain<sup id="footnote-anchor-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> that was parked, but because this whole static HTML thing is very much an experiment (one that I am enjoying thus far), I didn't want to spend more money on hosting just yet. Besides, for static HTML sites there are numerous options for free hosting.</p>
      <p>The simplest solution for me was to just host it through GitHub Pages. I have already been hosting my <a href="https://mpospese.github.io/cv/">CV</a> there since 2018. This means that my entire website is a <a href="https://github.com/mpospese/mpospese.github.io/">public repo</a>, with all of its files and commit history fully visible to the public. I'm OK with that though; websites are public by design.</p>
      <p>I wanted source control for my new website anyway. That way I can review file history and easily revert anything that borks the site. Having the source control <i>be</i> the website just kills two birds with one stone. So far I am pleased with the arrangement.</p>

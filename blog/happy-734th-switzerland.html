      <p>Happy Swiss National Day!</p>
      <p>I hiked up to the White Cross above town and then upon my return picked up coffee and the traditional 1.-August Weggen bread rolls.</p>

      <p>Later in the day I attended the community celebration for an apero, free risotto, and live music.</p>
      <p>Tonight we'll enjoy a cheese fondue for dinner. (Despite it being summer, it's actually been fondue weather recently.)</p>
      <p>Same as <a href="happy-733rd-switzerland.html">last year</a>, I'm grateful that I'm on a local contract and get local Swiss holidays off.</p>

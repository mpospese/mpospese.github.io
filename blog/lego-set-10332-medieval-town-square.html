      <p>My early Christmas present to myself for 2024. I opened this early because I want to have the time to build it while I'm off from work. A little LEGO building time each day in addition to walking, cooking, movies, and reading sounds like just the thing. This set should make a nice accompaniment to set 10305: Lion Knight's Castle.</p>

      <p>We begin with the carpenter/woodworker minifig and several small builds mostly for her shop, but it also includes a cart selling cheese and bread. I love the storytelling already on view with the 3-legged table (propped up by a stump) and a new table leg turning on the lathe. A stickered tile on the broken table shows plans for a chair, and then we build the exact chair.</p>

A blue and white awning shades the entrance and a dark wooden door is visible within. A tree, some mushrooms, and some flowers decorate the grass in front of the entrance." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The ground floor of the woodworker's shop boasts a neat blue and white awning. I especially enjoyed the mushrooms growing on the front lawn.</p>

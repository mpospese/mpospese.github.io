      <p>My early Christmas present to myself for 2024. I opened this early because I want to have the time to build it while I'm off from work. A little LEGO building time each day in addition to walking, cooking, movies, and reading sounds like just the thing. This set should make a nice accompaniment to set 10305: Lion Knight's Castle.</p>

      <h2 id="bag-1">Bag 1</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-01.webp" alt="LEGO cheesemaker's cart, several small builds for a carpenter's workshop, and a female carpenter minifigure" width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>We begin with the carpenter/woodworker minifig and several small builds mostly for her shop, but it also includes a cart selling cheese and bread. I love the storytelling already on view with the 3-legged table (propped up by a stump) and a new table leg turning on the lathe. A stickered tile on the broken table shows plans for a chair, and then we build the exact chair.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-2">Bag 2</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-02.webp" alt="Gray stone ground floor of a LEGO building. A blue and white awning shades the entrance and a dark wooden door is visible within. A tree, some mushrooms, and some flowers decorate the grass in front of the entrance." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The ground floor of the woodworker's shop boasts a neat blue and white awning. I especially enjoyed the mushrooms growing on the front lawn.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-3">Bag 3</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-03.webp" alt="Roofless gray stone upper floor of a LEGO building with a crane hoisting a wagon wheel. A red bird perches on the arm of the crane." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The upper floor of the woodworker's shop has a folding ladder and a crane to help transfer heavy items.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-4">Bag 4</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-04.webp" alt="LEGO two story gray stone woodworker's shop covered with a thatched roof. A two-wheeled peasant's cart carrying a barrel and a pitchfork sits outside." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>We build the thatched roof of the woodworker's shop and a small peasant's cart, and with this I believe the woodworker's shop is now complete.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-5">Bag 5</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-05.webp" alt="LEGO ground floor of a farmhouse built in the Tudor half-timbered style. The interior features a hearth and a rack holding five spools of yarn." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The ground floor of the farm house is built in the Tudor half-timbered style. There's a hearth and a rack holding different colors of yarn. I appreciate the out-of-context chopsticks hanging from one wall.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-6">Bag 6</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-06.webp" alt="LEGO darkly thatched farmhouse roof with an inset white half-circle window." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The farmhouse roof gets a dark thatched treatment with an inset half-circle window.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-7">Bag 7</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-07.webp" alt="Exterior of LEGO darkly thatched farmhouse featuring a garden with carrots, pumpkins, beehive, and a pail of water. A LEGO minifig of an older man with wavy gray hair holds a pair of shears." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The farmhouse gets a garden complete with a beehive and even a bee.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-07-interior.webp" alt="Interior of LEGO farmhouse featuring a loom depicting a scene with a castle and knights jousting. A LEGO minifig of an older man with wavy gray hair holds a pair of shears." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>For the interior we get the weaver's loom and a stickered tapestry with a castle scene. This completes the farmhouse and it is attached to the woodworker's shop by a pair of hinges.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-8">Bag 8</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-08.webp" alt="Groundfloor of LEGO cheesemaker's shop with a counter full of different kinds of cheese, a white kitten eyeing a pail of milk, and a small boy holding a spoon." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>We start building the cheesemaker's shop in a tan and brown half-timbered style. The counter holds many types of cheese. I love the little white kitten.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-9">Bag 9</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-09.webp" alt="Roofless but otherwise complete LEGO A-frame cheesemaker's shop in light tan and brown." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>We complete the walls of the cheesemaker's shop. I like the high shelf with a bit more cheese plus a random mug.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-10">Bag 10</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-10.webp" alt="LEGO cheese maker's shop with light tan and brown half-timbered walls and tan thatched roof with smoking chimney" width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The cheesemaker's shop gets a thatched roof and chimney.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-11">Bag 11</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-11.webp" alt="Garden of LEGO cheesemaker's shop with gray goat, squirrel, water trough, wood rail fence, flowers, and a few stones." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>Squirrel and goat! I guess the cheesemaker makes goat cheese. This fenced garden completes the cheesemaker's shop and it is attached via hinges to the other side of the woodworker's shop.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-12">Bag 12</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-12.webp" alt="A gnarled and leafy LEGO tree by a patch of water. There are mushrooms, a lily flower, and a frog. A main wearing a brown hood and wolf-insignia tunic carries a crossbow. An axe leans against a saw horse holding a log." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>A shady tree with a shady crossbow-toting Wolfpack member loitering beneath it. (The Wolfpack were a short-lived LEGO Castle bad guy sub-theme from the early 90's.)</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-13">Bag 13</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-13.webp" alt="Foundations of a LEGO tavern. The walls are gray stone and brown wood. Cobbled stone steps form an entryway, and the floor is tiled in dark red and orange." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The foundations for a tavern. The cobbled stone steps leading up to the entrance are especially nice.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-14">Bag 14</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-14.webp" alt="Ground floor of a LEGO tavern. Walls are brown wood inset with dark green latticed windows. There is a tapped keg, a lute, and a board game, but only one place to sit." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The ground floor of the tavern comes together with a tapped keg. It's empty, so the barrel filed with transparent yellow tiles on the peasant's cart must be its replacement.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="bag-15">Bag 15</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/lego-10332-bag-14.webp" alt="Ground floor of a LEGO tavern. Walls are brown wood inset with dark green latticed windows. There is a tapped keg, a lute, and a board game, but only one place to sit." width=960 height=720 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

      <p>Seven years ago today we arrived in Switzerland from Virginia. I try to write these posts annually to take stock and reflect on the previous year.</p>
      <p>(Previous posts after <a href="https://mpospese.com/2018/08/02/a-year-in-switzerland/">one</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2020/08/02/3-years-in-switzerland/">three</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2021/08/02/4-years-in-switzerland/">four</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/08/02/five-years-in-switzerland/">five</a>, and <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/">six</a> years in Switzerland.)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Past Year</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>Nine months ago I started a new role as a Senior iOS Engineer for PassiveLogic. I've traveled to Salt Lake City and Amsterdam twice each. The work is very advanced, and I'm still not over my impostor syndrome, but I am enjoying it. For the first time since moving to Switzerland, I am on a local Swiss contract, so I get the standard four weeks of vacation, local Canton Zug holidays, and payments towards a Swiss pension.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Learning German</h3>
      <p>Last Fall I took a test prep course for the Goethe B1 German exam. I passed the exam in December.</p>
      <p>Last Fall and this Spring I attended a German conversation course that meets one day a week at a local school.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Integration</h3>
      <p>In April I applied for and received my <a href="https://crazymilk.net/blog/settling-in.html">settlement permit</a> (permanent residency).</p>
      <p>Also in April I started playing D&amp;D in-person with a group of Swiss friends in Zürich. We meet every second or third weekend. (I've played a lot of D&amp;D over the past three years but almost entirely online.)</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Internationally we visited Vienna, North Carolina, Boston, and London (apart from work trips). Within Switzerland we've visited Wengen, Mergoscia, Brienz, and Val Müstair.</p>
      <p>I feel we've made fewer weekend trips over the past year, in part because our son is busier now with high school.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Nature / Outdoors</h3>
      <p>I continue walking locally in the Ägeri valley. In the winter I snowshoe. When it's hot I go out on the lake on my standup paddle board.</p>
      <p>I didn't do any big day hikes in the past year, and I struggled to exercise regularly. I should have hiked, snowshoed, and paddled more often.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Last Year's Goals</h2>
      <p>So how did I do on last year's <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/#goals">goals</a>?</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Goals for our eighth year in Switzerland</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hike more stages of the Via Engiadina</li>
          <li>Spend a night in a mountain hut</li>
          <li>Exercise regularly</li>

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>We will definitely stay here until our son finishes high school next summer. I would like to stay longer. In three years we would be eligible for Swiss citizenship. At this point I really don't want to live anywhere else.</p>

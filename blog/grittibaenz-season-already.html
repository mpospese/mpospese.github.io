      <p>I was feeling a bit down this afternoon, so I decided to walk out to a local cafe for a cup of coffee and maybe a sweet treat. To my surprise it's already Grittibänz season. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stutenkerl">Grittibänz</a> are bread men made from sweet dough. They are traditional in December around Saint Nicholas Day (<a href="https://www.helvetickitchen.com/recipes/2017/12/4/grittibanz">Recipe</a>).</p>
      <p>It seems like the internet (and perhaps real life) is full of bad stuff lately. Be kind to yourself and don't forget to give yourself a little treat every now and then.</p>

    <main>
      <p>I launched this simple HTML + CSS site less than a month ago. At the time I didn't even know what a CSS selector was. I started with <a href="https://mikemai.net/mcss/">MCSS</a> by former coworker <a href="https://mikemai.net">Mike Mai</a>, and since then I have been slowly customizing it to suit my needs (Disclaimer: all design crimes have been committed by me). Recently I made two changes to personalize my CSS a bit more.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>1. CARTRIDGE: A Retro Font</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I love video games and old LEGO from the 1980's, so I wanted a font with a retro feel to use for headings. SimpleBits' <a href="https://simplebits.shop/products/cartridge">Cartridge</a> font fits the bill perfectly, and a license for a single domain website only costs a very reasonable 15 CHF. I decided to use all caps for H1 headers, but I'm not certain I'll stick with that choice.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="font-feature-settings: 'ss01';">CARTRIDGE: Stylistic Set 01</h3>
      <h3 style="font-feature-settings: 'ss02';">CARTRIDGE: Stylistic Set 02</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The font includes two stylistic sets with alternate glyphs for capital A,R,T, V, W, and Y. I really like the first set, but it doesn't look right with every word, so I'm not specifying it by default.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2. Swiss Flag Red</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I intentionally made my site just black and white for maximum contrast and easy support for light and dark modes, but I did want to add just a bit of color as an accent. Red always pairs well with black and white, and what better red than Swiss flag red? I like how it looks, and it has personal meaning for me.</p>

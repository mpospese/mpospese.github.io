      <p>I'm not religious, but I'm happy to live in a Catholic canton with frequent public holidays. In the past I've always had to work on these days (because it's not a holiday in the U.S.), but since last November I'm on a local Swiss contract and I had today off.</p>

Dark green forest borders the pasture, and the sky above is blue with puffy white clouds." width=960 height=540 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>I went for a long walk in the farm fields this morning, bought coffee and pastries from the one open bakery, watched a movie with my son, and now I'm watching him play Tears of the Kingdom while I mess around with this blog. Tonight there's part 2 of the Eurvision Song Contest semifinals. Life is good.</p>

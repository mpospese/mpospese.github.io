      <p>Today felt like an early summer day, except it's mid-April. I should be worried about whether we'll get one last snow and not beach weather. In any case it was a gorgeous morning to be out on Lake Ägeri. Apart from a couple fishing boats and some waterfowl, I had the lake to myself.</p>
      <p>There's a bakery located by the boat ramp where I put in, so I often grab a cup of coffee and balance it on the board. After a 30-minute paddle, I was sitting on my board and enjoying my first coffee of the day when I took this photo.</p>

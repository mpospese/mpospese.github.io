      <p>Today I restarted a daily exercise habit once again. For me that means at least a 30-minute walk or taking a watercraft out on the lake. Regular exercise is good for me and makes me feel good. Being out in nature works wonders for my mind and soul (and lets my subconscious ponder complicated coding issues). Yet I continually struggle to establish and keep a routine.</p>

      <p>Here's a cow pasture I can reach in less than five minutes' walk from my apartment. I love living next to farm land. There are chickens, cows, horses, and even some wallabies I can visit (not to mention the usual swarm of farm cats). There's little traffic and plenty of beautiful vistas to enjoy. So why is it so hard to make myself get out here regularly?</p>
      <p>I'm posting this as a reminder to myself to get off my ass and get outside. It's always worth it.</p>

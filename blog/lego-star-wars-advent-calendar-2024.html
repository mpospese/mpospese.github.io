      <h3>1 December 2024</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>It's December! That means time to build LEGO Star Wars micro builds for the next 24 days with my son.</p>
      <p>This is our fourteenth year opening the calendar together (and the final year before he goes off to university). All photos will be shot with an iPhone 14 Pro Max for the third straight year.</p>
      <p>This will be my first year posting advent calendar entries to a static blog. Instead of daily posts, I'm going to just update this one post each day (or as time and energy allow).</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-1">Day 1: X-Wing Starfighter</h2>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/x-wing-2024.webp" alt="LEGO microscale build of an X-Wing Starfighter" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>What is this thing? A shoe? Normally I'm a fan of original trilogy material, but this is a terrible micro build of one of the most iconic Star Wars spaceships. I'm guessing the blue stud is supposed to represent R2-D2, which would make this Luke's X-Wing.</p>

      </div> 
      <p>It has no shaping from front-to-back when viewed either from the top or from the side. Also the espresso pieces for wing cannons just looks off.</p>

      <p>These X-Wing's from 2020 (white) and 2019 (Poe Dameron's in orange and black) have much better shaping and better looking wing cannons than today's offering.</p>

      <h2 id="day-2">Day 2: Ugly Sweater Princess Leia</h2>

      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-2.webp" alt="Princess Leia Organa as a LEGO minifigure with a knitted holiday sweater decorated with an AT-AT attacking Hoth Echo Base, which is being defended by a turret cannon and a snowspeeder.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>OK, I just love the knitted AT-AT's on her sweater. It looks like artwork for the kind of video game I would try to make on the Atari 800 when I was a teenager. The back of her sweater has the shield generators, another snowspeeder, and a tauntaun!</p>

      <h3>Previous Ugly Sweater Minifigs</h3>
      <p>In previous years we've gotten five other minifigs in holiday sweaters. Two others also came holding coffee mugs.</p>

      <p>It's December! That means time to build LEGO Star Wars micro builds for the next 24 days with my son.</p>
      <p>This is our fourteenth year opening the calendar together (and the final year before he goes off to university). All photos will be shot with an iPhone 14 Pro Max for the third straight year.</p>
      <p>This will be my first year posting advent calendar entries to a static blog. Instead of daily posts, I'm going to just update this one post each day (or as time and energy allow).</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-1">Day 1: X-Wing Starfighter</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-01.webp" alt="LEGO microscale build of an X-Wing Starfighter" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>What is this thing? A shoe? Normally I'm a fan of original trilogy material, but this is a terrible micro build of one of the most iconic Star Wars spaceships. I'm guessing the blue stud is supposed to represent R2-D2, which would make this Luke's X-Wing. üëé</p>
      <br>

        </div>
      </div> 
      <p>It has no shaping from front-to-back when viewed either from the top or from the side. Also the espresso pieces for wing cannons just looks off.</p>

      </div>
      <p>These X-Wing's from 2020 (white) and 2019 (Poe Dameron's in orange and black) have much better shaping and better looking wing cannons than today's offering.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-2">Day 2: Ugly Sweater Princess Leia</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-02.webp" alt="Princess Leia Organa as a LEGO minifigure with a knitted holiday sweater decorated with an AT-AT attacking Hoth Echo Base, which is being defended by a turret cannon and a snowspeeder.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>OK, I just love the knitted AT-AT's on her sweater. It looks like artwork for the kind of video game I would try to make on the Atari 800 when I was a teenager. The back of her sweater has the shield generators, another snowspeeder, and a tauntaun! üëç</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Previous Ugly Sweater Minifigs</h3>
      <p>In previous years we've gotten five other minifigs in holiday sweaters. Two others also came holding coffee mugs.</p>

      <h2 id="day-3">Day 3: TIE Fighter</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-03.webp" alt="LEGO microscale TIE Fighter with blue highlights on the wings" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>This is a decent build. Certainly better than Day 1's boxy X-Wing. I wish they had included a transparent stud on the rear for the ion engines. üëç</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Previous Advent TIE Fighters</h3>
      <p>My favorite is 2016's TIE Interceptor with the printed dish for the cockpit.</p>

      <p>There were also TIE Fighters in the 2011 and 2021 calendars, but I don't have photos of those.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-4">Day 4: Super Battle Droid</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-04.webp" alt="LEGO super battle droid minifig" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>A super battle droid. While we've gotten a battle droid in almost every advent calendar, it's been 10 years since the last super battle droid. Grudging üëç</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Previous Advent Super Battle Droids</h3>
      <p>We've gotten super battle droids in two prior calendars. It looks like the molded head was wider on the droids from 10 years ago.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
            <figure>

            </figure>
        </div>
      </div> 
      <p>Regular battle droids are more common, having appeared in eight advent calendars between 2011 and 2023. They are arguably even lamer, but at least they mostly came with a blaster. Mostly.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-5">Day 5: AT-AT</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-05.webp" alt="LEGO microscale AT-AT with posable head and legs" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>Probably my favorite Imperial vehicle. This tidy little micro-scale build has decent articulation in the head. You can even make it look like it's cocking its head to one side.</p>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-05-side.webp" alt="LEGO microscale AT-AT from the side showing how flattened the body is." width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>When viewed from the side it seems too flattened. Instead of an elephant, it has the profile of a soft-shell turtle with flamingo legs. Another plate would have beefed up the body to the correct proportions. Still a solid üëç</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Previous Advent AT-AT's</h3>
      <p>We've come a long way since the 2012 model with telescopes for legs. My favorite is the Rogue One AT-ACT from 2018 although really it's largely identical to the 2015 version.</p>

      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-06.webp" alt="LEGO microscale Y-Wing Starfighter" width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>Another classic original trilogy spaceship. I'm not convinced by that yellow jumper plate used to shape the cockpit. Otherwise looks pretty good. I like the silver-colored stud for the astromech droid. üëç</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Previous Advent Y-Wing's</h3>
      <p>Today's model is a big improvement over the blocky Y-Wing from 2014, but I prefer the cockpit shape of the 2017 build.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">

      <p>There was another model of Anakin's Y-Wing in the original 2011 advent calendar, but it was identical to the 2014 version.</p>

      <h2 id="day-7">Day 7: Minikit</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-07.webp" alt="LEGO minikit collectible from the LEGO Star Wars video games. A white cylinder with dark gray highlights, green and red lights, and an antenna." width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>The minikit collectible from the LEGO Star Wars series of video games. My son and I used to play this together on the Wii. I am indifferent, but my son was enthusiastic. According to him this build redeems this year's calendars recent stumbles (he was more critical of the AT-AT and Y-Wing). üëç</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="day-8">Day 8: Jabba's Sail Barge</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/advent-2024-day-08.webp" alt="LEGO micro-scale model of Jabba's sail barge in brown with tan highlights and two dark orange sails." width=960 height=960 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>This is an excellent little build and easily recognizable. They even managed to get the sails hoisted on two little masts. üëç</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Previous Advent Sail Barge</h3>
      <p>Jabba's sail barge has appeared in the advent calendar once before in 2015, but it was much more rudimentary. The following day gave us the Sarlacc Pit to pair with it.</p>

      <p>Another great micro-scale model. The cheese grater slopes are perfect to form the Falcon's signature mandibles. üëç</p>

      <h3>Previous Advent Millennium Falcons</h3>
      <p>The 2020 version was pancake thin. I prefer the chunkier versions like we got today or in previous years.</p>

      <p>Living outside of the big city in Switzerland means living near farms, mostly small ones. I live near three small farms. They all sell their products in small honor system stores. For the farm next door I pick up eggs directly from the coop. They're actually cheaper than grocery store eggs, and I know the chickens are treated well because I can see them pecking in their yard from our apartment. Anyway I picked up fresh eggs on Saturday and was just reflecting on how different this is for me than life in the suburbs in the United States.</p>

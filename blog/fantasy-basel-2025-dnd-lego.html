      <p>On the final weekend of May I combined my love for LEGO and D&amp;D when I attended the <a href="https://fantasybasel.ch/en">Fantasy Basel</a> convention and ran four two-hour D&amp;D games using a <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/21348-1/Dungeons-Dragons-Red-Dragon-s-Tale">LEGO set</a> as a battle map and LEGO minifigures as the miniatures. (This was part of a volunteer effort by <a href="https://swissrpg.ch">Swiss RPG</a> that ran 63 two-hour games for 315 attendees over three days.) Everyone seemed to have a good time, so yay!</p>
      <p>I went into this not knowing whether this was a terrible idea or not, but the <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/marketing/lego/red-dragons-tale.pdf">published one-shot</a> worked pretty well for a 2-hour conference setting and every time the group was able to at least reach the final encounter with the evil sorcerer and the dragon within two hours. I definitely improved at running it with each play-through. I think I might try to run it again at <a href="https://herofest.ch/en">HeroFest</a> in Bern and/or <a href="https://www.zurichpopcon.ch/en">Zürich Pop Con</a> in the Fall.</p>

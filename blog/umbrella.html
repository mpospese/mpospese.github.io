      <p>Yesterday was a rainy day, so naturally when I went out in the morning for coffee and errands, I brought my umbrella. However, when I emerged from my favorite coffee shop, my umbrella was missing from the stand out front where I had left it. There was a similar umbrella in a slightly different color, so I hoped that someone had merely taken my umbrella by accident. I don't want the village I live in to be the kind of place where I have to worry about people stealing my shit.</p>
    <p>This morning when I went out for coffee, my umbrella had been returned. Faith in humanity reaffirmed (or at least faith in my fellow residents of this mid-sized Swiss village).</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-87">Via Engiadina</a> hiking trail in Switzerland is a 12-stage 165 km long-distance hiking trail along the entire length of the Engadine high alpine valley in the eastern canton of Graubunden. For several years I have wanted to hike the entire trail, but have only managed six stages (and never more than two stages on consecutive days).</p>
      <p>This summer I plan to finally hike the entire trail. I will do it in two sections: four stages in mid-June over the Corpus Christi long holiday weekend, and the remaining eight stages either in July or August.</p>
      <p>For the first four stages I will spend three nights in Silvaplana (my destination after the first stage). It might be more fun to spend each night in a different hostel as near as possible to the stage endpoints, but I have a few reasons for staying in Silvaplana:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I was too busy/lazy to book three different places.</li>
        <li>I really like <a href="https://pappalou.ch">Pappa Lou</a> restaurant on the lake in Silvaplana and won't mind eating there every night.</li>
        <li>When you stay more than two nights in the same place, you receive a regional travel card that also works for the mountain railways. I would really like to go up from Corvatsch one day after I've hiked my stage to visit <a href="fuorcla-surlej.html">Fuorcla Surlej</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I bought a new lightweight rain jacket (I've worn my previous one until it's rotting away), new trekking poles (I slipped and bent my old ones several years ago), and a pair of field binoculars, and I resoled my hiking boots. I'm really looking forward to this.</p>

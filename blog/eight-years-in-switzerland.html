      <p>Eight years ago today we moved to Switzerland. Once again it's time to take stock and reflect on the previous year.</p>
      <p>(Previous posts after <a href="https://mpospese.com/2018/08/02/a-year-in-switzerland/">one</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2020/08/02/3-years-in-switzerland/">three</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2021/08/02/4-years-in-switzerland/">four</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2022/08/02/five-years-in-switzerland/">five</a>, <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/">six</a>, and <a href="seven-years-in-switzerland.html">seven</a> years in Switzerland.)</p>

      <h2>The Past Year</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>I continue to enjoy working remotely for PassiveLogic. I've transitioned from working on iOS to writing cross-platform (non-UI) frameworks in Swift. I've traveled once to Salt Lake City, Utah and twice to Amsterdam to visit the offices there.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Learning German</h3>
      <p>Honestly I've not made much progress with my German. I participated in a discussion class last Fall, but so far in 2025 I've not formally studied. However, for the Fall I've signed up for two in-person classes and an online test prep course, and I've already registered for Goethe B2 Listening and Speaking tests in November. I will need the B2 tests in order to be eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Integration</h3>
      <p>I've made some progress this year. I continue to meet up in Zürich roughly monthly to play D&D with a group of Swiss friends (and I continue to run an online D&D campaign for a mostly different set of Swiss friends). Swiss RPG holds monthly get-togethers in Zürich, and I make an effort to attend those. Last month I even attended the first ever Zug get-together and met some folks closer to home (I hope to start playing more locally). I've run D&D games at Zürich PopCon and <a href="fantasy-basel-2025-dnd-lego.html">FaBa</a></p>
      <p>Last August I particpated in a local lake cleanup, which was good fun. The group of about 20 volunteers spent four hours removing trash from Lake Ägeri, and then we had a sunset cookout by the lake.</p>
      <p>In February I was invited to a fondue dinner / board game evening, which was amazing.</p>
      <p>Outside of the RPG group though, I struggle to make connections.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Apart from three business trips, I traveled to the UK to visit Cambridge with my son and domestically I've made a couple trips to Graubunden.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Nature / Outdoors</h3>
      <p>I continue to hike year-round, snowshoe in the winter, and standup paddle in the summer.</p>
      <p>I've been much more active in 2025 than I was in the previous year. In the first six months of 2025, I've already exercised outdoors more days and hiked farther than I did in all of 2024.</p>
      <p>I spent two nights up at the Berggasthaus Wildspitz (and have another night booked in two weeks). I hiked the <a href="via-engiadina-plans.html">first four stages of the Via Engiadina</a> six weeks ago, and today I head out to hike the remaining eight stages.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Last Year's Goals</h2>
      <p>How did I do on last year's <a href="seven-years-in-switzerland.html?#goals">goals</a>?</p>

        </ul>

      <br>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>Our son starts university in the UK in September. I'm not ready to be an empty-nester!</p>
      <p>That said, my plan is to stay right where we're at and eventually apply for my Swiss citizenship.</p>

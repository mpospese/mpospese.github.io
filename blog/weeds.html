      <p>The apartment we rent has a terrace. The part of the terrace that isn't wood decking or planters is covered in gravel. Despite a lack of soil, we're continually battling weeds that sprout up from the gravel. Fortunately they're easy to pull because there's not much for the roots to cling to.</p>
      <img src="https://crazymilk.net/files/images/photos/weeds.webp" alt="Closeup shot of a couple small arugula plants sprouting from the dark gray gravel surface of my apartment's terrace." width=1440 height=1080 loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
      <p>This Spring though we were happy to discover that many of the &quot;weeds&quot; are actually arugula! We grew arugula in our raised garden beds last year and let it go to seed, and this is the result. Last year we found oregano growing wild amongst the hedges in the planters.</p>
      <p>It makes me smile to think that future tenants of this apartment will have to contend with arugula, basil, chives, kale, mint, parsley, rosemary, sage, spinach, and thyme sprouting up everywhere. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

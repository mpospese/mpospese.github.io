      <p>Yesterday I received my settlement permit (permanent residency / C Permit) for Switzerland. That was one of my <a href="https://mpospese.com/2023/08/02/six-years-in-switzerland/#goals">goals for this year</a>, and now it's handled.</p>
      <p>Permanent residency has numerous advantages, such as the ability to move between cantons or change jobs at will. It is valid for 5 years instead of 1 or 2, and the renewal process is much simpler than for a residence permit (B Permit). Before I need to renew it, I will be eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship should we still be here and should I desire it.</p>
      <p>Does this mean I am fully integrated? By no means, but it is a step along the way. It's hard for an introvert to integrate anywhere, and Switzerland may be more challenging in this regard than many places.</p>
      <p>On a related note, after six years and eight months living in Switzerland, I have finally been invited to a Swiss person's house. It's to play D&amp;D, so even better!</p>

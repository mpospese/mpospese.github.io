      <p>Finally a sunny and calm morning to take out my SUP on Lake Ägeri after rainy days, gusty days, and second winter. I am super grateful for the opportunity to have these little moments of peace and tranquility in the beauty of nature.</p>
      <p>I love my standup paddle board. I didn't think I would when my wife suggested we get one in summer 2020. I have generally poor coordination and balance, and so I didn't think it would be for me. I do only take it out in the calmest of calm conditions. Early mornings are best before the wind picks up.</p>
      <p>My board gives me a sense of independence similar to what I felt when I got my first car at the age of 21. I can go anywhere I want (on a lake), when I want, and do what I want. I like that I can paddle, sit down, lie down, or swim from it. It has tie-downs so that I can bring food, drink, and gear with me in a dry bag. And I can balance a thermal mug of coffee at the front of the board without spilling it. My <i>modus operandi</i> is to paddle out half an hour to a quiet spot, sit down and drink my coffee, snap a few photos, and then paddle back.</p>

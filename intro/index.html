      <h3>Current</h3>
      <p>I have been living in Switzerland since 2017 and currently work remotely for <a href="https://passivelogic.com">PassiveLogic</a> as a Senior iOS Engineer.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I began programming in 1983 in BASIC on an Atari 800, but largely gave it up by the time I finished high school. In college I studied mathematics and later biology and marine biology. I earned a Master's in marine biology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and then moved to Brazil where I taught English as a Second Language. While I was in Brazil my father contacted me about writing a tutorial program to accompany an upcoming revision of his logic textbook. I agreed and taught myself Visual C++, Visual Studio and MFC to accomplish the task. By the time it was finished, my interest in programming had been renewed. The program (and two others) were published, and upon my return to the United States at the height of the dot com boom, I landed a full-time job as a computer programmer.</p>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>For over a decade I worked as lead developer at <a href="http://www.odysseyinc.com/">Odyssey Computing, Inc.</a> doing mostly consulting work. I began working in mobile with Windows CE in 1999 and continued to do so through about 2005, when Windows Mobile really began to wane. For the next few years I focused primarily on desktop software, but when the iPhone SDK was announced in 2008 I was immediately intrigued (at my company we were all using iPhones by then, despite our past history with Microsoft mobile devices).
      </p>
      <p>Next I spent a year and a half bringing rich user experiences to life on iOS with the team at <a href="http://yml.co">Y Media Labs</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I spent nearly four years working on cutting-edge apps for IoT hardware devices for <a href="http://ubnt.com">Ubiquiti Networks</a>.</p>
      <p>From 2018–2020 I consulted on a variety of mobile apps, including a full native rewrite of a hybrid mobile application (finance domain) that was delivered in just four months.</p>
      <p>Starting mid-2020 I helped BlockFi rewrite their React Native app to Swift and scale their mobile team from one person to a world-class fully-remote global engineering team of nearly a dozen.</p>
      <p>Mid-2021 I returned to Y Media Labs where I served for two years as a chapter lead for iOS. In this role I improved iOS Engineering across teams through education, thought leadership, mentorship, and by promoting best practices. I also lead the effort to create IP through reusable frameworks and engineer components for design systems. Our team released over a dozen highly unit-tested open source Swift packages that were used across projects to accelerate development, increase accessibility, and reduce defects.</p>
      <p>In Fall 2023 after a few months of freelance contracting, I joined PassiveLogic where I am excited to build out and improve their iOS app. I'm looking forward to a role that has the potential to make a difference with climate change.</p>
